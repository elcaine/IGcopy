# Design Ideas

## Quizzes/Activities/Games
Goal is to complete the quiz in the least amount of strokes
For each topic there is a bank of questions
Loaded from a file and randomized per attempt

## Content/Textbook
Markdown files that get automatically converted to html when the server starts, or maybe just render the markdown client-side. Rendering it client-side might make more sense.

## Quizzes
We store a list of questions and answers for each topic (MC only for now)
We store each user's solved questions for each topic

## Pages
Sign in/Registration page, also serves as landing page
User Home Page (user stuff)
Game Home (topic navigation)
Content/Textbook pages
Ability to open text/lessons is always visible (tool icon?)
Topic Specific Page (list of activities)
Activity Specific Pages
